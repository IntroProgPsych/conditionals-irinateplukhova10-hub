# You are tasked with creating a simple grading system for a class. 
# Write a Python program that takes a student's score as input
#  and calculates and prints its corresponding letter grade based on the following grading scale:

# 90 or above: A
# 80-89: B
# 70-79: C
# 60-69: D
# Below 60: F


score = int(input("Enter the student's score: "))
if score >= 90 and score <=100:
    print("A")
elif score >=80 and score <=89:
    print("B")    
elif score >=70 and score<=79:
    print("C") 
elif score >=60 and score <=69:
    print("D")
else:
    print("F")
